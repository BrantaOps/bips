Branta has the potential to evolve, over time, into a **protocol-level technology.**

The parallel is Bitcoin Consensus.
* In Bitcoin, TXns are signed with private keys and confirmed by the network.
* With Software applications, the installer is signed by the authors private PGP key and *should* be confirmed by the user.


In "Application Consensus" below, verification is done manually. In Bitcoin, nodes and miners handle this.

A distributed runtime (Branta) that acts as a filter _before_ install can act as consensus.
Branta should adopt BrIP (Branta Improvement Proposals) to standardize this.
