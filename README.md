# Branta as a Protocol
Branta has the potential to evolve, over time, into a **protocol-level technology.**

The parallel is Bitcoin Consensus.
* In Bitcoin, TXns are signed with private keys and confirmed by the network.
* With Software applications, the installer is signed by the authors private PGP key and *should* be confirmed by the user.


In "Application Consensus" below, verification is done manually. In Bitcoin, nodes and miners handle this.

A distributed runtime (Branta) that acts as a filter _before_ install can act as consensus by aggregating signatures for relevant Bitcoin Software.

Branta should define a BIP set (Branta Improvement Proposals) to standardize this.

# Initial BIP Set (Branta Improvement Proposal)
1. Branta must remain FOSS & MIT Licensed
2. Branta must define platform support
3. Branta must define allowed user inputs (file types, UI/UX, possible OS automation)
4. Branta must define user response (UI/UX, feedback noisy-ness)
5. Branta must define process for aggregating new fingerprints
6. Branta must define trusted source of truth for storing fingerprints (NOSTR?)
